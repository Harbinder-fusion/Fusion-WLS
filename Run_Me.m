% The main function for range compression ("WLS_Fusion.m")
% It takes as input a image sequence (3-channel), and
% returns as output the fused image.
% We find the default parameter setting works quite well for most image 
% series we've experimented with. To see default parameter settings, please
% refer article "Weighted Least Squares Based Detail Enhanced Exposure Fusion". 

% Referred code from others:
% wlsFilter routine:  described in Farbman, Fattal, Lischinski, and
%   Szeliski, "Edge-Preserving Decompositions for Multi-Scale Tone and Detail
%   Manipulation", which is available at https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/c95304a2-d9a9-4716-85e2-e01f1c7a841e/f735f344-a14b-4f70-9413-d9e381ac8992/previews/GRSL-Cloud_Detection_2018/functions/wlsFilter.m/index.html 
% The current package also contains routine used in diffusion process.
% it deals with anisotropy diffusion, which is authored by Aadarsh Malviya (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/31204-anisodiff-in-matlab).
